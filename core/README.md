# Moru (short of "„É¢„É´„É¢„ÉÉ„Éà" or "morumotto")

> A word to the previous owner of the `moru` package on npm:

> "I saw that the original package was unpublished in 2021 and is not available to install anymore. So I assume that you are not owning it now. If you have some concerns, please, write me back or open an issue here. I hope you don't mind if I take the name for my package."

Moru is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Simple**. The best way to use any library effectively is by understanding how it works. Moru is as small and as simple as possible, so it won't be too hard to explore the source code. And maybe you have some ideas to make it even simpler and better üòâ
- **Declarative**. It uses JSX to describe a markup in a HTML-like way. You probably already know pros and cons from the pioneer - [React](https://reactjs.org/). But Moru does not exploit Virtual DOM, so you won't pay a cost of reconciliation.
- **Reactive**. Reactivity is the core of the library. It is inspired by the [S](https://github.com/adamhaile/S) library, but aims to be much simpler and predictable.
- **Functional**. No class components.
- **Portable**. It is easy to write a runtime for any environment.

## Installation

```shell
npm i moru
```

The library is distributed as non-minified and non-transpiled source code, so you have to transpile it by yourself in a way you want. Luckily, you don't have to worry about it as any bundler does it by default.
