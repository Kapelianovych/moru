# `Moru`

**It is still in early development phase. Some API may change without warning.**

`Moru` is a lightweight UI library. It uses the JSX as view representation which is heavily inspired by React. Reactivity which it uses closely resembles the one SolidJS has. But despite not being invented, the project aims to have simpler implementation compared to mentioned libraries.

The idea is to provide the most minimal runtime for SPA by producing native DOM nodes with a help of small reactivity abstraction (basically a couple of hooks). It is easy to understand and easy to remember.
