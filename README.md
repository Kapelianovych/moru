# `Moru`

**It is still in early development phase. Some API may change without warning.**

`Moru` is a lightweight UI library. It uses the JSX as a view representation which is heavily inspired by React. It uses reactivity which closely resembles the one SolidJS has. But despite not being invented, the project aims to have simpler implementation compared to mentioned libraries.

The idea is to provide the simplest abstraction layer that can be translated into the UI depending of the environment and the reactivity system to propagate updates to the UI. The runtime for specific environment should be created separately by using former entities. It is easy to understand and easy to use.

> Abstraction layer it **not** the Virtual DOM. It is used solely for preserving information about UI elements for a renderer. After rendering it is completely discarded.
